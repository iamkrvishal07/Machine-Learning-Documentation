# Day 1

## Introduction to Data Science
- **Data Science**: An interdisciplinary field that applies statistical, analytical, and computer science techniques to extract insights and knowledge from domain-specific data.

## What is Data Science?
- **Components**:
  - **Statistics**: Methods to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data.
  - **Computer Science**: Tools and algorithms to process data.
  - **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of the specific field from which data is collected.

## What is Machine Learning?
- **Definition**: A subset of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
- **Applications**: Includes image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - **Description**: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Classification**: 
       - Spam detection: Identifying emails as spam or not spam.
       - Image recognition: Recognizing objects in images.
       - Sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment of a text (positive, negative, neutral).
     - **Regression**: 
       - Predicting house prices: Estimating the value of a house based on features like size, location, and condition.
       - Stock price prediction: Forecasting future stock prices based on historical data.
       - Demand forecasting: Predicting future demand for products in retail.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - **Description**: The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships on its own.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Clustering**: 
       - Customer segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
       - Social network analysis: Identifying communities within a social network.
       - Document clustering: Grouping similar documents for topic modeling.
     - **Association**: 
       - Market basket analysis: Finding associations between products purchased together.
       - Recommendation engines: Suggesting products based on user behavior.
       - Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - **Description**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, taking actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Game Playing**: 
       - AlphaGo: Learning to play and win the game of Go.
       - Chess engines: Learning strategies to win at chess.
       - Video games: Training AI to play video games autonomously.
     - **Robotics**: 
       - Autonomous driving: Training self-driving cars to navigate roads.
       - Robotic arms: Learning to perform tasks like assembling products.
       - Drone navigation: Training drones to navigate and perform tasks.

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
   - Examples: Web scraping, APIs, databases, sensors.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or fixing missing and inconsistent data.
   - Examples: Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data through statistical summaries and visualizations.
   - Examples: Summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, correlation analysis.
4. **Model Building**: Creating machine learning models using training data.
   - Examples: Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of models using test data.
   - Examples: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve.
6. **Deployment**: Integrating the model into a production environment for real-world use.
   - Examples: API deployment, embedding in applications, cloud deployment.
