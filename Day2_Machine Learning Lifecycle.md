### Process Overview
The machine learning lifecycle involves several critical steps to ensure the development and deployment of effective machine learning models. This process can be summarized as follows:

### Prior Knowledge

- **Gaining Information**: Understand the objective of the problem, the subject area, and identify relevant data sources.
  - **Objective**: Predict the price of a house based on its size.
  - **Subject Area**: Real estate, housing market.
  - **Relevant Data**: Data on house prices and sizes from real estate listings.
- **Simple Example**: Start with a basic example to understand the problem better and refine the approach.
  - **Example**: Predict house prices using just one feature: size.

### Data Preparation

- **Cleaning**: Remove or correct any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data.
  - **Example**: Remove entries with missing or negative values for size or price.
- **Processing & Transformation**: Convert raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
  - **Example**: Ensure all sizes are in square feet and prices in dollars.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform initial investigations on the data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses using summary statistics and graphical representations.
  - **Example**: Plot a scatter plot of price vs. size to see the relationship.
- **Missing Data Treatment**: Handle any missing data points using appropriate techniques such as imputation.
  - **Example**: If some house sizes are missing, fill them with the mean size.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensure all data types are correctly formatted for analysis.
  - **Example**: Ensure size and price are both numerical.
- **Data Centering & Scaling**: Normalize the data to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model performance.
  - **Example**: Scale the sizes so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identify and manage outliers to prevent them from skewing the analysis.
  - **Example**: Remove houses with prices or sizes that are extremely high or low.
- **Feature Selection & Data Sampling**: Choose relevant features and create representative samples to train the model efficiently.
  - **Example**: Use size as the feature to predict the price.

### Data Modelling

This step involves selecting appropriate algorithms and techniques to build predictive models based on the prepared data.

- **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable algorithm.
  - **Example**: Use Linear Regression to predict house prices based on size.
- **Model Training**: Train the model on the prepared data.
  - **Example**: Train the Linear Regression model using the training data.

### Evaluation of Test Data

Evaluate the model performance using test data to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score to evaluate the model.
  - **Example**: Calculate the MAE and R² score for the test data to see how well the model predicts house prices.

- **MAE**: Provides the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values are better.
- **R²**: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable. Values closer to 1 are better.


 # Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Definition:
MAE is a measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. It is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values.

## Interpretation:
- MAE gives an idea of how much error there is in the predictions on average.
- Lower MAE values indicate better model performance.
- MAE is easy to interpret because it uses the same units as the data.

# R² (R-squared)

## Definition:
R² is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.

## Interpretation:
- R² values range from 0 to 1.
- An R² of 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.
- An R² of 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.
- Higher R² values indicate a better fit of the model.


## Key Concepts and Techniques

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Objective**: Use graphical techniques (e.g., histograms, box plots) and statistical methods to summarize the main characteristics of the data.

**Example**: Create a scatter plot of price vs. size.

**Why**: EDA helps in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions in the data. It provides insights that can guide further analysis and model building.
    
## Data Cleaning
**Objective**: Correct or remove erroneous values, address inconsistencies, and ensure data quality.

**Example**: Remove rows with negative values for size or price.

**Why**: Negative values for size or price are not realistic for this context and would negatively impact the model's performance.

## Data Transformation
**Objective**: Normalize, standardize, and encode categorical variables as needed.

**Example**: Scale the size values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

**Why**: Scaling ensures that features contribute equally to the model's performance and improves the convergence of gradient descent algorithms.

## Missing Data Handling
**Objective**: Handle missing data points using appropriate techniques such as imputation.

**Example**: Fill missing size values with the mean size.

**Why**: Imputation allows us to use all available data without discarding rows, which preserves the dataset size and provides more data for training the model.

## Outlier Management
**Objective**: Detect using statistical tests (e.g., Z-score, IQR) and decide whether to remove or adjust them.

**Example**: Remove houses with prices or sizes far outside the typical range.

**Why**: Outliers can skew the results of the model and lead to poor performance. Managing them ensures a more accurate and reliable model.

## Feature Selection
**Objective**: Use methods like correlation matrices, feature importance scores from models, or algorithms like recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select the most relevant features.

**Example**: Use size as the main feature to predict price.

**Why**: Feature selection helps in reducing the complexity of the model, improving performance, and preventing overfitting by using only the most relevant features.

## Model Evaluation Metrics
**Objective**: Depending on the problem type (classification or regression), use appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, RMSE, etc.

**Example**: Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score to evaluate the regression model.

**Why**: Evaluation metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance and help in comparing different models to select the best one.
